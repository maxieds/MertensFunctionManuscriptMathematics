# Why is this information so scatter brained?

This artifact of the 2019-2022 pandemic in Atlanta, GA
is some combination of the fact that I was severely drugged 
on campus at Georgia Tech during that time. And surely also some 
point-and-click (lesser than script kiddie) a--hole with 
physical access to my computer systems thinking they are 
"*getting away with murder*" or somehow putting something 
over on me by modifying and inserting obnoxious 
classic counter examples in analysis type gotchas into the sources 
of these typeset manuscripts (*Do you know what that means, Maxie?*). 
As in the GT ACO/Math syndrome 
communicated to me in one class that there is only one *right* 
(correct) solution to any given problem -- and moreover, that 
it must conform to some arbitrarily defined short length. 
Kind of like the difference between understanding graduate level 
complex analysis by reading Gamelin and knowing the non-intuitive 
slick proofs from Ahlfors. 
What pray tell are we (the, as in singular, not entire) applied 
mathematicians to do after qualifying exams? I suppose the ACO/CS 
veterans might reason about the Turing tape / halting problem. 
Existential philosophy is a notable b-tchy difficult woman, indeed. 

# More angry meta-comments about this repository

More information is contained here for 
information's sake. That is, for the 
conspiracy theorists at large. I also sincerely expect that this 
collection should top the best of the memorable flawed proofs of the 
Riemann Hypothesis on arXiv and/or viXra (thank you, Trevor, for that 
reference point). 

More to the point, irritating Princetonian arrogantia and mass 
proliferation of misinformation be damned: 
**I want my $1M! (and I want it now)**
My childhood IQ score was a 165, for whatever lifetime merit 
achieving that statistic really means forever and ever after. 
NB, one good online confidant and amateur historian of mine 
suggested that his was a 161. 

To quote an email exchange from the pandemic era of this generation 
(to the tune of Kelis, of course): :musical_note:
*Damn right, it's better than yours. I could teach you, but 
I'd have to charge.* :musical_note: 
(My **source code**, 
it's better than your's, I could teach you, but I'd 
have to charge ...)

Michael Lacey alleged that I was a "hacker" rather than 
professional mathematician at one point after he saw me give 
a live demonstration of my official contribution as a "hacker app" 
(displaying the hot pink 'Chicky' theme, mind you) with a 
Chameleon Mini RevG device. This man is so cocky and techically 
``NULL`` that he really believes I can be put away like Kevin Mitnick 
for being a software-type **hacker** (like ESR). Or possibly murdered, 
if need be, for pissing him off. Why do we have to justify this 
with a big bad hacker label? In room of like-minded men that 
already agree with you, what is the point of the bullsh-t? 
There's an intimidation factor that gives men like this a 
quick cheap thrill, for sure.
