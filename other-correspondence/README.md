The key to social interactions is being subtle to let others infer what you must surely be communicating rather than being precise -- Shades of gray and fascist policy towards everything. I am not good at hinting around the bush. 

The following recording is an example of a psychological intimidation tactic known as *gaslighting*: [https://youtu.be/wpuQhwGxe3A](https://youtu.be/wpuQhwGxe3A). The next linked recording captures the same professor of mathematics behaving inappropriately at my doctoral oral qualifying exam in August of 2020: [https://youtu.be/nrv3cbGvYr0](https://youtu.be/nrv3cbGvYr0). 

I will point to an on-campus interaction from a few years ago that should point out more of the mannerisms of this old fellow. Namely, following a retraction of a Princeton *Annals* publication due to a heinous counterexample brought out of the closet, he drew Cartesian coordinate axes crudely in the plane with two spherically shaped oblong surfaces to show me what he was frustrated with me about that day. He then proceeded to dot each ellipsoid-like shape in their centers as though they were references to a woman's breasts on the white board in his office: '*Ahhh! Flatland. Start there and work your way up.*' On another occasion around that time, he chose to make derogatory comments about all the women in his life smoking in front of undergraduates attending office hours. The other female student of his at the time decided to quit smoking. On the otherhand, I recall remarking: '*Ughh! For NO man!*' This is all very unfortunate.
